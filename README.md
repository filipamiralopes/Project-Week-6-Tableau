# Insights on public hospitals in Victoria, Brazil
For this project the main goal was making use of Tableau, a powerful tool for data visualisation. For that, I found a dataset with data from public hospital units in Victoria,Brazil, which included information as Show/no-Show on medical appointment, waiting time for an appointment (since the moment the patient calls to make an appointment), health conditions, etc.

## Project Description
	Dashboard 1) I started by plotting conditions vs. waiting time, so we could quickly see which conditions were taking longer to be addressed; I connected gender and age group to this so we could have a nice overview of the female/male and age ratio inside each condition.
	Dashboard 2) I went to investigate which hospital units (neighbourhoods) were having longer waiting times, and if that was somehow resulting in more no-shows on the appointments.
	Dashboard 3) Finally I went to investigate a bit more on the scholarship (allowance from the Government): if patients with it were actually showing up or not, and who were these patients, how many days they were waiting for an appointment, and if they had received a warning message or not. It is not ideal a person being receiving help from the Government and then not showing up to the appointments; one can access these patients and check if a reminder message was sent or understanding why the person didn't show up (e.g. waiting time).
